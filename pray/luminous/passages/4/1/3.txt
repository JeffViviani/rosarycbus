	<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was on the bank of the great river, the Tigris. <span class="brf">As I looked up, I saw a man dressed in linen with a belt of fine gold around his waist. His body was like chrysolite, his face shone like lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and feet looked like burnished bronze, and the sound of his voice was like the roar of a multitude.</span> I alone, Daniel, saw the vision; but great fear seized those who were with me; they fled and hid themselves, although they did not see the vision. So I was left alone to see this great vision. No strength remained in me; I turned the color of death and was powerless. <span class="brf">When I heard the sound of his voice, I fell face forward unconscious.</span></p>

	<p>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month I was by the great river which is the Tigris. <span class="brf">And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw: and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with the finest gold: And his body was like the chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as a burning lamp: and his arms, and all downward even to the feet, like in appearance to glittering brass: and the voice of his word like the voice of a multitude.</span> And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw it not: but an exceeding great terror fell upon them, and they fled away, and hid themselves. And I being left alone saw this great vision: and there remained no strength in me, and the appearance of my countenance was changed in me, and I fainted away, and retained no strength. <span class="brf">And I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard, I lay in a consternation, upon my face, and my face was close to the ground.</span></p>
