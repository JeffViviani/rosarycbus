	<p>And Elisha saw it happen. He cried out, "My father! my father! Israel's chariot and steeds!" Then he saw him no longer. He gripped his own garment, tore it into two pieces, and picked up the mantle which had fallen from Elijah. Then he went back and stood at the bank of the Jordan. Wielding the mantle which had fallen from Elijah, he struck the water and said, "The Lord, the God of Elijah&mdash;where is he now?" He struck the water: it divided, and he crossed over.</p>
	<p><span class="brf">The guild prophets in Jericho, who were on the other side, saw him and said, "The Spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." They went to meet him, bowing to the ground before him. They said, "Among your servants are fifty brave men. Let them go in search of your master. Perhaps the spirit of the Lord has lifted him up and left him on some mountain or in some valley."</span> He answered, "Do not send them." But they kept urging him, until he was embarassed and said, "Send them." So they sent fifty men, who searched for three days without finding him.</p>

	<p>And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces. And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him: and going back, he stood on the bank of the Jordan, And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said: Where is now the God of Elias? And he struck the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither, and Eliseus passed over. <span class="brf">And the sons of the prophets at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it said: The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus. And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground, And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord hath taken taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.</span> And he said: Do not send. But they pressed him, till he consented, and said: Send. And they sent fifty men: and they sought three days but found him not.</p>
