	<p><span class="brf">After six days <span class="suc">Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain</span> apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no fuller on earth could bleach them. Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus.</span> Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, "Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified. Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them; then from the cloud came a voice, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him." Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone with them.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">And after six days <span class="suc">Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain</span> apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them. And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller upon earth can make white. And there happened to them Elias and Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.</span> And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. For he knew not what he said: for they were struck with fear. And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved son; hear ye him. And immediately looking about, they saw no man anymore, but Jesus only with them.</p>
