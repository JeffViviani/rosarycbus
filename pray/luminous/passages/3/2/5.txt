When it is full they haul it ashore and sit down to put what is good into buckets. What is bad they throw away.</span> Thus it will be at the end of the age. <span class="suc">The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous</span> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.</p>
