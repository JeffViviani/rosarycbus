	<p><span class="brf">"In your vision, O king, you saw a statue, very large and exceedingly bright, terrifying in appearance as it stood before you.</span> Its head was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its belly and thighs bronze, its legs iron, its feet partly iron and partly clay. <span class="brf">While you watched, a stone was hewn from a mountain without a hand being put to it, and it struck its iron and clay feet, breaking them in pieces.</span> The iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold all crumbled at once, fine as the chaff on the threshing floor in summer, and the wind blew them away without leaving a trace. <span class="brf">But <span class="suc">the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain</span> and filled the whole earth.</span></p>

	<p><span class="brf">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold <i>there was</i> as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.</span> The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass: And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
	<p><span class="brf">Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</span> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's thrashingfloor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: <span class="brf">but <span class="suc">the stone that struck the statue, became a great mountain</span>, and filled the whole earth.</span></p>
