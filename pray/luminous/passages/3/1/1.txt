If, then, you find pleasures in throne and scepter, you princes of peoples, honor Wisdom, that you may reign as kings forever.</span></p>

	<p>For the beginning of her is the most true desire of discipline. And the care of discipline is love: and love is the keeping of her laws: and the keeping of her laws is the firm foundation of incorruption: And incorruption beingeth near to God. <span class="brf">Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom. If then your delight be in thrones, and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, love wisdom, that you may reign for ever.</span></p>
