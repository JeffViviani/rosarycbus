	<p><span class="brf">Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: and from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.</span> And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper, and my redeemer.</p>
