	<p><span class="brf">So they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him." John answered and said,</span> "<span class="suc">No one can receive anything except what has been given him from heaven.</span> You yourselves can testify that I said [that] I am not the Messiah, but that I was sent before him. The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man, who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. <span class="brf">So this joy of mine has been made complete. He must increase; I must decrease.</span></p>

	<p><span class="brf">And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him. John answered and said:</span> <span class="suc">A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.</span> You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, that I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. <span class="brf">This my joy therefore is fulfilled.
