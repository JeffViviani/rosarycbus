	<p>Now that very day two of them were going to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were conversing about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were conversing and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him. [...] As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. But they urged him, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over." <span class="brf">So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but <span class="suc">he vanished from their sight.</span></span> Then they said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning [within us] while he spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us?"</p>

	<p>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, names Emmaus. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them. But their eyes were held, that they should not know him. [...] And they drew nigh to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther. But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. <span class="brf">And he went in with them. And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and <span class="suc">he vanished out of their sight.</span></span> And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in the way, and opened to us the scriptures?</p>
