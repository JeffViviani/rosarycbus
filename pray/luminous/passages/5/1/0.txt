And thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold within and without: and over it thou shalt make a golden crown round about:</span> And four golden rings, which thou shalt put at the four corners of the ark: let two rings be on the one side, and two on the other. Thou shalt make bars also of setim wood, and shalt overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put them in through the rings that are in the sides of the ark, that it may be carried on them. And they shall always be in the rings, neither shall they at any time be drawn out of them. <span class="brf"><span class="suc">And thou shalt put in the ark the testimony which I will give thee.</span></span></p>
