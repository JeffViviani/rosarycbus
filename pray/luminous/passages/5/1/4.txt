	<p>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. <span class="brf">This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever."</span> These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</p>

	<p>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by me. <span class="brf">This is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead. He that eateth this bread, shall live for ever.</span> These things he said, teaching in the synagogue, in Capharnaum.</p>
