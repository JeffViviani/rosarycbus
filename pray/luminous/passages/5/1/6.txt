	<p>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.</p>
	<p><span class="brf">Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. A person should examine himself, and so eat the bread and drink the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgement on himself.</span> That is why many among you are ill and infirm, and a considerable number are dying. <span class="suc">If we discerned ourselves, we would not be under judgement.</span></p>

	<p>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come. <span class="brf">Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.</span> Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep. <span class="suc">But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span></p>
