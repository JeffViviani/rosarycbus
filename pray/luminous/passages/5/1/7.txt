	<p><span class="brf">If any man whosoever of the house of Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among them, eat blood, I will set my face against his soul, and will cut him off from among his people: Because the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul.</span> Therefore I have said to the children of Israel: No soul of you, nor of the strangers that sojourn among you, shall eat blood.</p>
