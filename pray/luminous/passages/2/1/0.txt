	<p><span class="brf">Let not wine be the proof of your strength, for wine has been the ruin of many. <span class="suc">As the furnace tests the work of the smith, so does wine the hearts of the insolent.</span> Wine is very life to anyone, if taken in moderation. Does anyone really live who lacks the wine which from the beginning was created for joy? Joy of heart, good cheer, and delight is wine enough, drunk at the proper time.</span> Headache, bitterness, and disgrace is wine drunk amid anger and strife. Wine in excess is a snare for the fool; it lessens strength and multiplies wounds. Do not wrangle with your neighbor when wine is served, nor despise him while he is having a good time; Say no harsh words to him nor distress him by making demands.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">Challenge not them that love wine: for wine hath destroyed very many. <span class="suc">Fire trieth hard iron: so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the hearts of the proud.</span> Wine taken with sobriety is equal life to men: if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be sober. What is his life, who is diminished with wine? What taketh away life? death. Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful, and not to make them drunk. Wine drunken with moderation is the joy of the soul and the heart.</span> Sober drinking is health to soul and body. Wine drunked with excess is bitterness of the soul. The heat of drunkenness is the stumblingblock of the fool, lessening strength and causing wounds. Rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine: and despise him not in his mirth. Speak not to him words of reproach: and press him not in demanding again.</p>
