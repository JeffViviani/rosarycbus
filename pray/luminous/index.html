Then he suffered him. <span class="brf">And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.

						<p>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine." And Jesus said to her, "Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come." <span class="brf">His mother said to the servers, "Do whatever he tells you." Now there were six stone water jard there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told them, "Fill the jars with water," So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them, "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter." So they took it. And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from (although the servers who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him, "Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now."</span> Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs in Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.</p>

						<p>And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there. And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage. And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine. And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? my hour is not yet come. <span class="brf">His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye. Now there were set thee six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece. Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the brim. And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it. And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine, and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the bridegroom, And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee; and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</p>

				<p class='guide'>[Prayer to Saint Joseph]</p>
				<p>To you, O Blessed Joseph, do we come in our tribulation. And having implored the help of your most holy spouse, we confidently invoke your patronage also. Through that charity which bound you to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God, and through the paternal love with which you embraced the child Jesus, we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance which Jesus Christ has purchased by his blood, and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities. O Most watchful guardian of of the Holy Family, defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ. O Most Loving Father, ward off from us every contagion of error and corrupting influence. O Our Most Mighty Protector, be kind to us, and from Heaven assist us in our struggle with the power of darkness. As once you rescued the child Jesus from deadly peril, so now protect God's Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity. Sheild, too, each one of us by your constant protection, so that supported by your example and your aid, we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness, and to obtain eternal happiness in Heaven. Amen.</p>
