					<p>Queen of the Holy Rosary, you have deigned to come to Fatima to reveal to the three shephard children the treasures of grace hidden in this rosary. Inspire our hearts with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the mysteries of our redemption which are recalled in it, we may be enriched with its fruits, obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the favor of which we ask you in this rosary.</p>
					<p>We pray for the intentions of the Church, those of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Chaste Heart of Joseph, and those intentions we now lift up silently.</p>

					<p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth. And in Jesus Christ His only son, Our Lord. Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into Hell. On the third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there He will come to judge the living and the dead. <span class="red">I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.</span></p>

O Most watchful guardian of the Holy Family, defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ. O Most Loving Father, ward off from us every contagion of error and corrupting influence. O Our Most Mighty Protector, be kind to us, and from Heaven assist us in our struggle with the power of darkness. As once you rescued the child Jesus from deadly peril, so now protect God's Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity. Sheild, too, each one of us by your constant protection, so that supported by your example and your aid, we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness, and to obtain eternal happiness in Heaven. Amen.</span></p>
