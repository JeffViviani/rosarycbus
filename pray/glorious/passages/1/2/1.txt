	<p>When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him.

	<p>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen. And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre? <span class="brf">And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished. Who saith to them: <span class="suc">Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.</span></span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you. <span class="suc">But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them</span>: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.</p>
