	<p><span class="brf">On the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, <span class="suc">"They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don't know where they put him."</span></span> So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first; he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in. <span class="brf">When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place. <span class="suc">Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed.</span></span> For they did not yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">And on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre. She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: <span class="suc">They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</span></span> Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and they came to the sepulchre. And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in. <span class="brf">Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying. And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place. <span class="suc">Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed.</span></span> For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</p>
