	<p><span class="suc">But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb and saw two angels in white sitting there</span>, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been. <span class="brf">And they said to her, <span class="suc">"Woman, why are you weeping?"</span> She said to them, "They have taken my Lord, and I don't know where they laid him." When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did not know it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?" She thought it was the gardener and said to him, <span class="suc">"Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him." Jesus said to her, "Mary!"</span> She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabbouni," which means Teacher.</span> Jesus said to her, "Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, 'I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and what he told her.</p>

	<p><span class="suc">But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, And she saw two angels in white, sitting</span>, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid. <span class="brf">They say to her: <span class="suc">Woman, why weepest thou?</span> She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him. When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking that it was the gardener, saith to him: <span class="suc">Sir, if thou has taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith to her: Mary.</span> She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).</span> Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.</p>
