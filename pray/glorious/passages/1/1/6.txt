	<p>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. <span class="suc">Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid</span>. <span class="brf">You heard me tell you, 'I am going away and I will come back to you.' If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you this before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.</span> I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming. He has no power over me, but the world must know that I love the Father and that I do just as the Father has commanded me. Get up, let us go.</p>

And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</span> I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing. But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
