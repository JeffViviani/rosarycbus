	<p>But at daybreak Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men; furthermore they lacked the helmets and swords they wanted. They saw the army of the Gentiles, strong, breastplated, and flanked with cavalry, and made up of experienced soldiers. Judas said to the three men with him: "Do not fear their numbers or dread their attack. Remember how our ancestors were saved in the Red Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. <span class="brf">So now let us cry to Heaven in the hope that he will favor us, remember the covenant with our ancestors, and destroy this army before us today. All the Gentiles shall know that <span class="suc">there is One who redeems and delivers Israel</span>."</span></p>

	<p>And when it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men only, who neither had armour nor swords. And they saw the camp of the Gentiles that it was strong, and the men in breastplates, and the horsemen round about them, and these were trained up to war. And Judas said to the men that were with him: Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault. Remember in what manner our fathers were saved in the Red Sea, when Pharao pursued them with a great army. <span class="brf">And now let us cry to heaven: and the Lord will have mercy on us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and will destroy this army before our face this day: And all nations shall know that <span class="suc">there is one that redeemeth and delivereth Israel</span>.</span></p>
