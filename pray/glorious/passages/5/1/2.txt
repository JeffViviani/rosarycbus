	<p><span class="brf">She glowed with perfect beauty and her face was as joyous as it was lovely, though her heart was pounding with fear. <span class="suc">She passed through all the portals till she stood before the king</span>, who was seated on his royal throne, clothed in full robes of state, and covered with gold and precious stones, so that he inspired great awe.</span> As he looked up in extreme anger, his features fiery and majestic, the queen staggered, turned pale and fainted, collapsing against the maid in front of her. But God changed the king's anger to gentleness. In great anxiety he sprang from his throne, held her in his arms until she recovered, and comforted her with reassuring words. "What is it, Esther?" he said to her. "I am your brother. Take courage! You shall not die; this order of ours applies only to our subjects. Come near! Raising the golden scepter, he touched her neck with it, embraced her, and said, "Speak to me." She replied: "I saw you, my Lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was shaken by fear of your majesty. For you are awesome, my lord, though your countenance is full of mercy.  As she said this, she fainted.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes, hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear. So <span class="suc">going in she passed through all the doors in order, and stood before the king</span>, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.</span> And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid. And God changed the king's spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words: What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not. Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others. Come near then, and touch the sceptre. And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me? She answered: I saw thee, my Lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty. For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of graces. And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.</p>
