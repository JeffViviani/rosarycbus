	<p><span class="suc">The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom</span>, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation. And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God. Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her. The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are long-lived.</p>
