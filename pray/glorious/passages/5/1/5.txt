	<p><span class="brf">For she is a breath of the might of God and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled can enter into her. For <span class="suc">she is the reflection of eternal light</span>, the spotless mirror of the power of God, the image of his goodness.</span> Although she is one, she can do all things, and she renews everything while herself perduring; Passing into holy souls from age to age, she produces friends of God and prophets. For God loves nothing so much as the one who dwells with Wisdom. <span class="brf">For she is fairer than the sun and surpasses every constellation of the stars. Compared to light, she is found more radiant;</span> though night supplants light, wickedness does not prevail over Wisdom.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emanation of the glory of the almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her. For <span class="suc">she is the brightness of eternal light</span>, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his goodness.</span> And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets. For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it. For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.</p>
