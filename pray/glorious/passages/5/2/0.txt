	<p><span class="brf"><span class="suc">A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet</span>, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. She was with child and wailed aloud in pain as she labored to give birth.</span> Then another sign appeared in the sky; it was a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadems. Its tail swep away a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth. <span class="suc">Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth, to devour her child when she gave birth. She gave birth to a son, a male child, destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod.</span> Her child was caught up to God and his throne. The woman herself fled into the desert where she had a place prepared by God, that there she might be taken care of for twelve hundred and sixty days.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">And <span class="suc">a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun</span>, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars: And being with child, she cried travailing in birth, and was in pain to be delivered.</span> And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns: and on his heads seven diadems. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: <span class="suc">and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered; that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her son. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod</span>: and her son was taken up to God, and to his throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her a thousand two hundred sixty days.</p>
