When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. <span class="brf">[Jesus] said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the holy Spirit. <span class="suc">Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained.</span></span></p>
