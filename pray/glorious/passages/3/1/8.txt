	<p>For who knows God's counsel, or who can conceive what the Lord intends? For the deliberations of mortals are timid, and uncertain our plans. For the corruptible body burdens the soul and the earthly tent weighs down the mind with its many concerns. <span class="brf">Scarcely can we guess the things on earth, and only with difficulty grasp what is at hand; <span class="suc">but things in heaven, who can search them out?</span> Or who can know your counsel, unless you give Wisdom and send your holy spirit from on high?</span></p>

	<p>For who among men is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of God is? For the thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain. For the corruptible body is a load upon the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the mind that museth upon many things. <span class="brf">And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth: and with labour do we find the things that are before us. <span class="suc">But the things that are in heaven, who shall search out?</span> And who shall know thy thought, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above:</span></p>
