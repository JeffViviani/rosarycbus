	<p>"But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you. <span class="brf">But if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes he will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and condemnation: sin, because they do not believe in me; righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me; condemnation, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.</span></p>
	<p>"I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now. <span class="suc">But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth.</span> He will not speak on his own, but he will speak what he hears, and will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you. Everything that the Father has is mine; for this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.</p>

	<p>But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; <span class="brf">but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgement. Of sin: because they believed not in me. And of justice: because I go to the Father, and you shall see me no longer. And of judgement: because the prince of this world is already judged.</span> I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now. <span class="suc">But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth.</span> For he shall not speak of himself, but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you. He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you. All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.</p>
