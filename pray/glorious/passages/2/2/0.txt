	<p>He said to them, "Go into the whole world and proclaim the gospel to every creature. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. Whoever does not believe will be condemned. <span class="brf">These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons, they will speak new languages. They will pick up serpants [with their hands], and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover." So then the Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.</span> But they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through accompanying signs.</p>

	<p>And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned. <span class="brf">And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpants; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover. And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on right right hand of God.</span> But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</p>
