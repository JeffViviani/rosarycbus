	<p><i>"Son, why have you done this to us?"</i> &mdash;Luke 2:48</p>
	<p>Oftentimes Christ feels distant. We experience a great desolation, as if He could not be farther from our heart. Are we confident that Christ is still about His Father's work in our lives, even when we experience no fervor? Do we reject the suggestions of the devil that we are not loved, that Christ has forsaken us, and that we can never find Him again? Or do we take these devilish deceptions to our hearts and our own demise?</p>
	<p>Does a young woman whose newly wed husband goes off to war experience suffering? Yes. Mary and Joseph had great suffering at the loss of Christ. Does this young woman experience joy, too, knowing that the virtue of her husband is being exercised from afar, for her own safety and well-being? Yes.</p>
	<p>This lesson is in the Gospel for us so that we are not led astray. How can we have joy when we feel not Christ's presense? Can we trust that He is doing His Father's work, and that in some plan of divine providence, our desolation is going to work for the good of our souls if we resist it, and that consolation will one day return as God's abundant gift?</p>
	<p><i>But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go.</i> &mdash;John 16:7</p>
