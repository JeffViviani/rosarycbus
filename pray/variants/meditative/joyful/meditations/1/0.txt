	<p><i>"Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus."</i> &mdash;Luke 1:31</p>
	<p>There is a tendency that can grow in each of us to always expect bad news and reject any good news. Good news can be met with a pessimism that results in hopelessness. With the Annunciation, we see that Our Blessed Mother is one who embraces good news with joy: the coming of the Messiah to her very womb!</p>
	<p>In our day-to-day lives, different news makes its way to us. How do we react to that which is good? Do we, like Mary, react with such selfless joy so as to merit a visit to a friend to share in such joys, or do we confront good news with a attitude of gloom, assurred that it will be usurped by some foreboding circumstance?</p>
