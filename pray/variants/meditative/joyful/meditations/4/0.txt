	<p>As Simeon holds the child Jesus in his arms, recognizing Jesus not by his own insight but from the Spirit, he is joyful enough to die at that very moment:</p>
	<p><i>â€œNow, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation"</i> &mdash;Luke 2:29-30</p>
	<p>How can we bring Christ into our arms and so be gifted the peace that Simeon was?</p>
