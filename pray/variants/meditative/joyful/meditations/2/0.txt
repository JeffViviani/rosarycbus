	<p><i>When Elizabeth heard Maryâ€™s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb</i> &mdash;Luke 1:41</p>
	<p>The miracle in Mary's womb is far greater than that in Elizabeth's womb, yet Mary is more preoccupied with paying Elizabeth a joyous visit than worrying about her own future. The little joys to Mary are worth her time. Our Blessed Lord said:</p>
	<p><i>The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones;</i> &mdash;Luke 16:10</p>
	<p>Does it not follow that if we have joy in the little matters, we will also have joy in great matters like Mary? She spends three months with Elizabeth! Typically one will spend much time with one who is ill &mdash; Mary spent a long time with Elizabeth when she was well.</p>
