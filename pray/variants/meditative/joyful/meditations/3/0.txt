	<p>How great is our recognition that we need a savior? The angel appeared to the lowly shepherds on the night watch:</p>
	<p><i>The angel said to them, â€œDo not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord."</i> &mdash;Luke 2:10-11</p>
	<p>They dropped everything and went into Bethelehem! They worried not of leaving their flock of sheep because the Good Shepherd had come into the world to watch over <i>all</i> sheep. The shepherds longed for a savior because they knew they were powerless on their own. Do we attribute our spiritual progress to our own efforts? Do we view the spiritual life as us climbing up to God, or rather as God coming down to us, as a humble babe, to lift us up above His cross that appears as a sword plunging into Hell and an arrow pointing to Heaven? The essense of being poor in spirit is that we cannot claim ownership over our spiritual goodness: God has come to us to save us, because we cannot save ourselves.</p>
	<p><i>"It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you"</i> &mdash;John 15:16</p>
