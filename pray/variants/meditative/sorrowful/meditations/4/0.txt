	<p>O Blood and Water which gushed forth from the heart of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in you!</p>
	<p>To truly grasp the difficulty of carrying a heavy wooden cross on a bloody and torn apart back and shoulders is impossible unless you have endured it personally. However, many of us have endured some pretty heavy things, both spiritually and emotionally carrying them throughout our life. Imagine carrying all the weight of the emotional and physical pain ever endured in your life in a wooden box, only your hands are torn down to the bones and the wood is splintering into the tears. Now multiply that wooden box by the number of people ever existed and ever going to exist. That is the pain he endured upon the way of the cross as he took on the weight of the sins ever committed and to be committed by human kind.</p>
	<p>The Mercy of Christ is that he endured every trial and hardship you have and ever will endure with and for you, taking on our sins for and with us, and he did it the moment he surrendered to God in the Garden. He continues to with the carrying of the cross. He endures everything for you. When you fall, he is right there with you encouraging you to get back up, to persevere, to press on in the pursuit of the goal, the prize of God's Upward calling, in Christ Jesus (Phil 3:14) Hear his voice calling you to get up, take your cross and follow him.</p>
	<p>On the way of the cross, Jesus, with the help of a certain Simon of Cyrene, carries the weight of the sins of all mankind. Here, Jesus teaches us a very important lesson: it is good to accept help. Also on the way of the cross, Jesus is still being beaten, mocked, and is still bleeding. The cup of salvation is now filled to the brim, but Jesus isn't just full of mercy, love, and goodness. He is overflowing with Mercy, Love, and Goodness and he will go to the very end for you and with you. Trust that he is near to you offering himself up for you.</p>
