	<p>O Blood and water which gushed forth from the heart of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in you!</p>
	<p>Mockery affects the heart especially. Here we see Jesus, the most wonderful and loving man, mocked and ridiculed for who he is. So many people know the pain of being bullied, being mocked and ridiculed for who they are. Perhaps we have even done the mocking of others.</p>
	<p>The Roman soldiers mocked, spat upon, and beat Jesus before they pounded the crown of thorns the size of your fingers onto his head. The words, "Hail King of the Jews" was yelled at him in mockery when it should have been cried out in love and adoration. Yet, Jesus endured it all silently out of love and obedience.</p>
	<p>Though his heart was breaking at their words filled with hate, Jesus forgave them at every word and beating. His heart kept beating with love as his head shed blood along with every lashing endured through his scourging and beating. The blood shed here for us fills the chalice of suffering nearly to the brim, more than enough for our salvation, but God doesn't stop at more than enough. After all, a fountain won't work if the water is just to the brim, it has to overflow.</p>
	<p>In times of mockery for being children of God, disciples of Christ, let us turn to Christ and endure it with him in silence and trusting obedience, never jeering back.</p>
