	<p>O Blood and water which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in you!</p>
	<p>Jesus, in prayerful agony, sweated blood thinking of what was to come the next day with His Passion while the disciples were asleep. Here, we see Jesus so stressed over what is to come that His body literally sweats blood. The first drops of blood shed for us were not just shed over stress of the suffering to be endured, but also over the stress of eternal seperation from us which would happen if He didn't go through with the Passion. In His love and Mercy for us He says to the Father, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will" (Mttw 26:39)</p>
	<p>He, "who, though in the form of God, did not regard equlity with God something to be grasped. Rather, he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness, and found in human appearance, he humbled himself becoming obedient to death, even death on the cross" (Phil 2:6-8).</p>
	<p>He emptied himself to fill the chalice of salvation: for the forgiveness of sins. The chalice begins to fill with the first drops of blood Christ sheds for us. These drops of blood would have been enough, one drop of His blood would have been enough, but God doesn't stop at enough. Blood and water gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus, not just dripped, gushed. They gushed forth as a fount of Mercy for us because He loves us.</p>
	<p>May we grow in understanding of the love Christ sheds for us, and run to Him when we fall, so that He may envelop us in His Mercy.</p>
