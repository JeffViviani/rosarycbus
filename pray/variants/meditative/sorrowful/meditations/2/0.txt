	<p>O Blood and water which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in you!</p>
	<p>This mystery is a hard one to relate to. We no longer witness scourgings anymore, but we do see brutal beatings people have endured. Perhaps even some of us have endured severe physical or emotional beatings. We live in such a blessed time in which for some of us, the most pain endured physcally by the hands of another comes from a just punishment when we misbehaved as kids and were spanked. However, Jesus is innocent; He endured our just punishment for us.</p>
	<p>If you think about the worst physical pain you've ever endured, it might not even be as much pain as one lashing, but say it is. If the worst pain we ever endured was one lashing and we miultiplied it by the amount of times Jesus was lashed, thousands of times, then we can somewhat comprehend the pain Jesus endured for us. Why? For the forgiveness of sins. Each drop was shed out of love and forgiveness because Jesus is Mercy.</p>
	<p>Each sin we commit, big or small, is a lashing against the Heart of Jesus. We tear the flesh of His Heart to pieces with our sins, yet with each drop of blood He forgives us. The cup of salvation fills even more with the blood shed at the scourging. Jesus offers it to us as a fount of Mercy that we may come to know the Love of Christ and accept His love.</p>
	<p>May we grow in love and forgivness of ourseves and others as we follow Christ's example, trusting in His Mercy forever.</p>
