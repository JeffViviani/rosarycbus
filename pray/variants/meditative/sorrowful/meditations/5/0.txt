	<p>O Blood and Water which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in you!</p>
	<p>"Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what they do'" (Luke 23:34). Even as we continue to sin, continue to pound the nails into Jesus's outstretched hands, he offers us forgiveness, interceding for us to the Father.
	<p>To even breathe takes so much strength to lift oneself by the crucified hands and feet. How much more strength does it take to bring oneself up so that they can cry out in forgivness? Yet the strength of Love Christ has for us moves him. To forgive takes strength and love, as St. Paul writes, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Phil 4:13). We can find the strength to forgive ourselves and others through Christ.</p>
	<p>"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, and see if I do not open the floodgates of Heaven for you, and pour down upon you blessing without measure!" (Malachi 3:10). Jesus Christ is the food in the house of the Lord, he has offered his entirety to God for us by becoming the whole tithe in his sacrificial offering of himself. He endured the test of the passion, offers us his crucified body and blood, and by his sacrifice the floodgates of Heaven are opened and his Mercy is the blessing poured out upon us without measure.</p>
	<p>Why? Beacause he loves us, and like he said to the Good theif, "Amen I say to, today you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43), he wants us to be with him in Heaven for eternity. That is why he offered himself for us, that is why, upon realizing Jesus was dead, "one soldier thrust his lance into his side and immediately blood and water flowed out" (John 19:34). The blood and water that gushed forth from the heart of Jesus gushed forth for you as a fount, an overflowing fount, of Mercy so that you could spend eternity with Jesus in Heaven. Will you trust him to lead you there? Will you deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow him (Mtt 16:24) whom gave it all for you, trusting that he will not lead you astray nor give you anything you can't handle?</p>
	<p>Jesus, I trust in your Love.</p>
	<p>Jesus, I trust in your Goodness.</p>
	<p>Jesus, I trust in your Mercy.</p>
