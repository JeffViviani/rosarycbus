	<p><span class="brf">When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star at its rising and have come to do him homage."</span> When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They said to him, "In Bethelehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet: 'And you, Bethelehem, land of Judea, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; since from you shall come a ruler, who is to shephard my people Israel.'" Then Herod called the magi secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star's appearance. He sent them to Bethelehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, that I too may go and do him homage." <span class="brf">After their audience with the king they set out. And behold, the star that they had seen at its rising preceded them, until it came and stopped over the place where the child was. <span class="suc">They were overjoyed at seeing the star</span>, and on entering the house they saw the child with Mary his mother. They prostrated themselves and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their country by another way.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to adore him.</span> And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born. But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda. For so it is written by the prophet: <i>And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda; for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel.</i> Then Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them; And sending them into Bethehem, said: Go and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come and adore him. <span class="brf">Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was. <span class="suc">And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</span> And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back another way into their country.</p>
