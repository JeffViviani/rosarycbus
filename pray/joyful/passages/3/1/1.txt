	<p><span style="brf">I thought: How I would like to make you my children! So I gave you a pleasant land, the most beautiful heritage among the nations! You would call me, "My Father," I thought, and you would never turn away from me.</span> But like a woman faithless to her lover thus have you been faithless to me, house of Israel&mdashoracle of the Lord. A cry is heard on the heights! the plaintive weeping of Israel's children, Because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the Lord, their God.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">But I said: How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of the Gentiles? And I said: Thou shalt call me father and shalt not cease to walk after me.</span> But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised me, saith the Lord. A voice was heard in the highways, weeping and howling of the children of Israel: because they have made their way wicked, they have forgotten the Lord their God.</p>
