Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, who took them in my arms; but they did not know that I cared for them. <span class="brf">I drew them with human cords, with bands of love; I fostered them like those who raise an infant to their cheeks, I bent down to feed them.</span></p>

	<p><span class="brf">As the morning passeth, so hath the king of Israel passed away. Because Israel was a child, and I loved him: and <span class="suc">I called my son out of Egypt.</span></span> As they called them, they went away from before their face: they offered victims to Baalim, and sacrificed to idols. And I was like a foster father to Ephraim, I carried them in my arms: and they knew not that I healed them. <span class="brf">I will draw them with the cords of Adam, with the bands of love: and I will be to them as one that taketh off the yoke on their jaws: and I put his meat to him that he might eat.</span></p>
