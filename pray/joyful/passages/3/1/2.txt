	<p><span class="brf">A prophet like me will the Lord, your God, raise up for you from among your own kindred; that is the one to whom you shall listen.</span> This is exactly what you requested of the Lord, your God, at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, "Let me not again hear the voice of the Lord, my God, nor see this great fire any more, or I will die." And the Lord said to me, What they have said is good. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kindred, and will put my words into the mouth of the prophet; the prophet shall tell them all that I command.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a prophet of thy nation and of thy brethren like unto me: him thou shalt hear.</span> As thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the assembly was gathered together, and saidst: Let me not hear any more the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see any more this exceeding great fire, lest I die. And the Lord said to me: They have spoken all things well. I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their brethren like to thee: and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.</p>
