	<p><span class="brf">And Hannah prayed: "My heart exults in the Lord, my horn is exalted by my God. I have swallowed up my enemies; I rejoice in your victory.</span> There is no Holy One like the Lord; there is no Rock like our God. Speak boastfully no longer, do not let arrogance issue from your mouths. For an all-knowing God is the Lord, a God who weighs actions. "The bows of the mighty are broken, while the tottering gird on strength. <span class="brf">The well-fed hire themselves out for bread, while the hungry no longer have toil. The barren wife bears seven sons, while the mother of many languishes. "The Lord puts to death and gives life, casts down to Sheol and brings up again.</span> The Lord makes poor and makes rich, humbles, and also exalts. He raises the needy from the dust; from the ash heap lifts up the poor, To seat them with nobles and make a glorious throne their heritage. "For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he has set the world upon them. He guards the footsteps of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall perish in the darkness; for not by strength does one prevail. The Lord's foes shall be shattered; the Most High in heaven thunders; the Lord judges the ends of the earth. May he give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed!"</p>

	<p><span class="brf">My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation.</span> There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, and there is none strong like our God. Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared. The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength. <span class="brf">They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened. The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again.</span> The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth. He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and upon them he hath set the world. He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, because no man shall prevail by his own strength. The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.</p>
