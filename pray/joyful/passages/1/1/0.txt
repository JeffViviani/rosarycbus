	<p>There was a certain man from Zorah, of the clan of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren and had borne no children. <span class="brf">An angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her: Though you are barren and have had no children, you will conceive and bear a son.</span> Now, then, be careful to drink no wine or beer and to eat nothing unclean, for you will conceive and bear a son. No razor shall touch his head, for the boy is to be a nazirite for God from the womb. It is he who will begin to save Israel from the power of the Philistines.</p>

	<p>Now there was a certain man of Saraa, and of the race of Dan, whose name was Manue, and his wife was barren. <span class="brf">And an angel of the Lord appeared to her, and said: Thou art barren and without children: but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.</span> Now therefore beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. Because thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a Nazirite of God, from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.</p>
