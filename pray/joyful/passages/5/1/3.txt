And the book of Isaias the prophet was delivered unto him.</span> And as he unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written: <i>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.

And all gave testimony to him: and they wondered at the words of grace that proceeded from his mouth, and <span class="suc">they said: Is not this the son of Joseph?</span></span></p>
