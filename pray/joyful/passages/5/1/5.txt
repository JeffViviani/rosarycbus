	<p><span class="suc">Resplendent and unfading is Wisdom</span>, and she is readily perceived by those who love her, and found by those who seek her. She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her; one who watches for her at dawn will not be disappointed, for she will be found sitting at the gate. <span class="brf">For setting your heart on her is the perfection of prudence, and whoever keeps vigil for her is quickly free from care; Because she makes her rounds, seeking those worthy of her, and graciously appears to them on the way, and goes to meet them with full attention.</span></p>

	<p><span class="suc">Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away</span>, and is easily seen by them that love her, and is found by them that seek her. She preventeth them that covet her, so that she first sheweth herself unto them. He that awaketh early to seek her, shall not labour: for he shall find her sitting at his door. <span class="brf">To think therefore upon her, is perfect understanding: and he that watcheth for her, shall quickly be secure. For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, and she sheweth herself to them cheerfully in the ways, and meeteth them with all providence.</span></p>
