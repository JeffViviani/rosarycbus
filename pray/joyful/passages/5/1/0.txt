	<p><span class="brf">Whoever loves a son will chastise him often, that he may be his joy when he grows up.</span> Whoever disciplines a son will benefit from him, and boast of him among acquaintances. Whoever educates a son will make his enemy jealous, and rejoice in him among his friends. At the father's death, he will seem not dead, for he leaves after him one like himself, Whom he looked upon through life with joy, and in death, without regret. Against his enemies he has left an avenger, and one to repay his friends with kindness. Whoever spoils a son will have wounds to bandage, and will suffer heartache at every cry. An untamed horse turns out stubborn; and a son left to himself grows up unruly. Pamper a child and he will be a terror for you, indulge him, and he will bring you grief. <span class="brf">Do not laugh with him lest you share sorrow with him, and in the end you will gnash your teeth. Do not give him his own way in youth, and do not ignore his follies.</span></p>

	<p><span class="brf">He that loveth his son, frequently chastiseth him, that he may rejoice in his latter end, and not grope after the doors of his neighbours.</span> He that instructeth his son shall be praised in him, and shall glory in him in the midst of them of his household. He that teacheth his son, maketh his enemy jealous, and in the midst of his friends he shall glory in him. His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself. While he lived he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died he was not sorrowful, neither was he confounded before his enemies. For he left behind him a defenders of his house against his enemies, and one that will requite kindness to his friends. For the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds, and at every cry his bowels shall be troubled. A horse not broken becometh stubborn, and a child left to himself will become headstrong. Give thy son his way, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he shall make thee sorrowful. <span class="brf">Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow, and at the last thy teeth be set on edge. Give him not liberty in his youth, and wink not at his devices.</span></p>
