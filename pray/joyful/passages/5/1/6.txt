Solomon answered:</span> "You have shown great kindness to your servant, David my father, because he walked before you with fidelity, justice, and an upright heart; and you have continued this great kindness toward him today, giving him a son to sit upon his throne. Now, Lord, my God, you have made me, your servant, king to succeed David my father; <span class="brf"><span class="suc">but I am a mere youth, not knowing at all how to act&mdash; I, your servant, among the people you have chosen</span>, a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted. Give your servant, therefore, a listening heart to judge your people and to distinguish between good and evil.</span> For who is able to give judgement for this vast people of yours?"</p>

	<p><span class="brf">And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee. And Solomon said:</span> Thou hast shewn great mercy to thy servant David my father, even as he walked before thee in truth, and justice, and an upright heart with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: <span class="brf"><span class="suc">and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in. And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast chosen</span>, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people and discern between good and evil.</span> For who shall be able to judge this people, thy people which is so numerous?</p>
