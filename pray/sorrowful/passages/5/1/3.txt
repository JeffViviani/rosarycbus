	<p><span class="brf">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for <span class="suc">I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>
