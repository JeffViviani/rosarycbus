	<p>When I came to you, brothers, proclaiming the mystery of God, I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom. <span class="brf">For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span> <span class="suc">I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling</span>, and my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive [words of] wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.</p>

	<p>And I, brehtren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ. <span class="brf">For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span> And <span class="suc">I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span> And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power; That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</p>
