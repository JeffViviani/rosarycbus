	<p>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of the Skull), <span class="suc">they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall. But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.</span> <span class="brf">After they had crucified him, they divided his garments by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there.</span> [...] From noon onward, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. And about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <i>"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?"</i> which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Some of the bystanders who heard it said, "This one is calling for Elijah." Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge; he soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed, gave it to him to drink. But the rest said, "Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him." <span class="brf">But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit. And behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. And coming from their tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.</span></p>

	<p>And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary. <span class="suc">And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</span> <span class="brf">And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: <i>They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</i> And they sat and watched him.</span> [...] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias. And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him. <span class="brf">And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent. And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose, And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.</span></p>
