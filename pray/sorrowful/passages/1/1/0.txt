	<p><span class="brf">As the sun was about to set, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great, dark dread descended upon him.</span> Then the Lord said to Abram: Know for certain that your descendents will reside as aliens in a land not their own, where they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years. But I will bring judgement on the nation they must serve, and after this they will go out with great wealth. You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace; you will be buried at a ripe old age.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, amd a great and darksome horror seized upon him.</span> And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred years. But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after this they shall come out with great substance. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.</p>
