	<p><span class="brf">Every friend declares friendship, but there are friends who are friends in name only. <span class="suc">Is it not a sorrow unto death when your other self becomes your enemy?</span></span> "Alas, my companion! Why were you created to fill the earth with deceit?" A harmful friend will look to your table, but in time of trouble he stands aloof. A good friend will fight with you against the foe, and against your enemies he will hold up your shield. Do not forget your comrade during the battle, and do not neglect him when you distribute your spoils.</p>

	<p><span class="brf">Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death? <span class="suc">But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.</span>></span> O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness? There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him. There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against the enemy. Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.</p>
