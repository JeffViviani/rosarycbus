Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you. <span class="brf">For if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.</span></p>

And him that taketh away from thee thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every one that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again. And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them in like manner.<span class="brf">And if you love them that love you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also love those that love them.</span></p>
