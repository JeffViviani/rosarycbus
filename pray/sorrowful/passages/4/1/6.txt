	<p>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao: And they said to them: The Lord see and judge, because you have made our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have given him a sword to kill us. <span class="brf">And <span class="suc">Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people?</span> wherefore hast thou sent me? For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them.</span></p>
