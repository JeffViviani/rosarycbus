	<p><span class="brf">Is not life on earth a drudgery, its days like those of a hireling?</span> Like a slave who longs for the shade, a hireling who waits for wages, So I have been assigned months of futility, and troubled nights have been counted for me. When I lie down and say, "When shall I arise?" then the night drags on. I am filled with restlessness until the dawn. <span class="brf">My flesh is clothed with worms and scabs; my skin cracks and festers;</span></p>

	<p><span class="brf">The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.</span> As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work; so I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights. If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall I arise? and again I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness. <span class="brf">My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust, my skin is withered and drawn together.</span></p>
