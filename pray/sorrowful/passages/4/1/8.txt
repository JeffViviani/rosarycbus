	<p><span class="brf">They returned from reconnoitering the land forty days later.</span> Proceeding directly to Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh, they made a report to them and to the whole community, showing them the fruit of the land. <span class="brf">They told Moses: "We came to the land to which you sent us. It does indeed flow with milk and honey, and here is its fruit. However, the people who are living in the land are powerful, and the towns are fortified and very large.</span> Besides, we saw descendants of the Anakim there. Amalekites live in the region of the Negeb; Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites dwell in the highlands, and Caananites along the sea and the banks of the Jordan."</p>
	<p><span class="brf"><span class="suc">Caleb, however, quieted the people before Moses and said, "We ought to go up and seize the land, for we can certainly prevail over it."</span> But the men who had gone up with him said, "We cannot attack these people; they are too strong for us."</span> They spread discouraging reports among the Israelites about the land they had reconnoitered, saying, "The land that we went through and reconnoitered is a land that consumed its inhabitants.

	<p><span class="brf">And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days</span>, having gone round all the country, And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharam, which is in Cades. And speaking to them and to all the multitude, they shewed them the fruits of the land: <span class="brf">And they related and said: We came into the land to which thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits. But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are great and walled.</span> We saw there the race of Enac. Amalec dwelleth in the south, the Hethite and the Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the mountains: but the Chanaanite abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan. <span class="brf">In the mean time <span class="suc">Caleb, to the still murmuring of the people that rose against Moses, said: Let us go up and possess the land, for we shall be able to conquer it.</span> But the others, that had been with him, said: No, we are not able to go up to this people, because they are stronger than we.</span> And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed, before the children of Israel, saying: The land which we have viewed, devoureth its inhabitants: the people, that we beheld, are of tall stature.</p>
