				<p>Welcome to Rosary Cbus! We are a group that prays the rosary every night together. This website serves as a resource for the group and a free resource for anybody on the web looking how to pray the rosary.</p>
				<p>While the same basic structure exists across rosaries, one will find that different sources have variations in the ways they open and close, announce the mysteries and meditations, etc. With that said, the hope is that the formatting of the prayer on this website is both easy and spiritually rich for people new to the prayer to follow along.</p>
				
				<center><h2 class='big-pretty-text'>DYNAMIC SCRIPTURAL MEDITATIONS</h2></center>
				<p>All of sacred scripture revolves around these core mysteries that are contemplated while the rosary is prayed. Everything from Genesis 1 through Revelation 22 is about Christ and these sacred mysteries. We wanted to do <i>all</i> of sacred scripture its due justice. You will find a unique element to the scriptures on Rosary Cbus: they are always changing.</p>
				<p>If you navigate, for example, to the <a href="pray/joyful/index.html">Joyful Mysteries</a> webpage, you will find a scripture passage or two for every meditation. These scriptures <b>change every so often automatically!</b> The scriptures are not just restricted to the actual events themselves (typically in the Gospels), but scriptures from everywhere in the Bible that shed light on these mysteries keep things fresh and interest in God's Word high.</p>
				<p>Oh, and did we also mention you get to choose between the New American Bible Revised Edition and Douay-Rheims translation? That's right. Readings God's beautiful word in different Catholic translations provokes further thought, which is desirable during meditation. Come back every week to Rosary Cbus and expect entirely fresh scripture to meditate on.</p>
